          <!-- STEP 6 - BUILDING THE UI -->
          <!--
          I have setup most of the page and Gulp stuff for you. Your job is to
          build the grid of charts as shown in the example image.

          I recommend reading this W3Schools article on the Bootstrap Grid System first.
          https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_grid_system.asp

          Build a 1 row, 3 column bootstrap grid.
          Inside the first column:
            - Add an h1 element for the graph title
            - Insert the HTML for an Angular Line Chart underneath.
              (You can find the example HTML here: http://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/)

              You will need to pass `chartsCtrl.bigMac.data` to the `chart-data` directive,
              and `chartsCtrl.bigMac.labels` to the `chart-labels` directive.

          Once you've done that, you should see the chart appear before your eyes,
          and our application is complete!

          __If it didn't work for you__
          - Check your console and fix as many errors as you can, starting
            from top to bottom. (SyntaxErrors are easy fixes - find those first!)

          - If you get stuck, try using Google to find the answer. Copy the error
            into Google and see what happens, trimming unique parts of your search
            term away to broaden your search.

          - If all else fails, come find me!

          __If it worked for you__
          - Try adding some more complex charts with multiple series and see if you
            can find any interesting correlations between data points provided by
            INQstats!

          - To reduce the amount of code you had to write, try representing the charts
            themselves as an array of objects in Angular like this:

            ```js
            vm.charts = [{
              name: 'Big Mac Index',
              key: 'bigmac_index'
            }, {
              name: 'Birth Rate',
              key: 'birth_rate'
            }]
            ```

            It is possible using the data structure above to reduce the amount of code
            drastically.

            The only hint I will give you - Remember that arrays are objects in JavaScript,
            and you can access property values either using dot notation (`obj.key`)
            or array notation (`obj['key']`).
